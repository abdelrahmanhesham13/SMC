    <!--about smc intro-->
    <string name="about_smc">The Srinagar City became star attraction for reasons of its location,
        physical setting and the water ways. The living conditions of the inhabitants of Srinagar City
        were not as good as other states of India and a need grew up to create a body of law and rules
        on municipal administration in the State and for introduction of the local self government.
    The history of the S.M.C dates back to 1886 when the Monarchy established a department to look
        after the civic affairs of the Srinagar City and Jammu City as Municipal Committees under
        J and K Municipal Act No. 16 of 1886.The Srinagar Municipal Committee functioned as a State Department
        with all its members nominated (05 official and 11 unofficial) by the Government and its functions
        included all civil construction projects , health and hygiene management , water works and fire
        fighting within the limits.</string>
