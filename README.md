Srinagar Municipal Corporation presents T-Governance based mobile App.
The App has the GIS maps of all wards embedded and linked to enable the complainant to automatically detect the complaint ward and hence the complaint automatically gets assigned to the concerned ward officer/ concerned authority as per the present location of where the issue has happened. The complaint can besides this also send a live picture as a proof/ supporting material to his complaint which will be automatically captured by his mobile phone and geotagged and assigned to the concerned officer for quick response. The officers have limited time to respond otherwise the complaint will get escalated to the higher authorities for non-action .only the complainant can close the complaint per satisfaction. The complainant only needs a smart phone with Android and a working mobile connection to follow the complaints. SMS based notifications and OTP generation are also a prime feature of this system.
